//First create pizza object.

//Then create separate toppings (pepperoni, sausage, canadianBacon, peppers, mushrooms).

//Create functions to place toppings on pizza.

//Present pizza with all the toppings on it.

//Place order.

//Create new order.


//Business Logic
function pizza(toppings, size) {
    this.toppings = toppings;
    this.size = size;
}


//UI Logic
